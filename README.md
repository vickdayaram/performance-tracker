# Performance Tracker

## Description

Performance-Tracker is a single page app used to view charted stock and ETF performance data.
Searched securities are saved in a watchlist which users can edit. The user's watchlist will
persist in their browser's localstorage for future viewing even after the app is shut down.
User's are also able to click on the security ticker on the watchlist to view additional
information on the security's Nasdaq page.
